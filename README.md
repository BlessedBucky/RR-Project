# Loan Default Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The project is to check whether the research paer named "Research on loan default prediction based on logistic regression, randomforest, xgboost and adaboost" is reproducible. This paper aims to predict loan default risks using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. The dataset link is shown as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data


## Environment Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Code Execution Instructions
After running the `project.py` file, the cleaned dataset will be saved as `credit_risk_dataset_cleaned.csv`.

The code performs the following data cleaning and preprocessing steps:


- **Removing Outliers**:
  - Records where `person_age` exceeds 100 or `person_income` exceeds 500,000 are removed.
  - Data entries where `person_emp_length` is greater than `person_age` are removed.
  - Records where `person_age` is greater than 60 are removed.
  - Missing values for `person_emp_length` removed.
  - Missing values for `loan_int_rate` removed.

- **Categorical Data Transformation**:
  - Categorical features (`person_home_ownership`, `loan_intent`, `loan_grade`, `cb_person_default_on_file`) are converted to category data type.

- **Feature Standardization**:
  - Numerical features (`person_income`, `loan_amnt`, `loan_int_rate`, `loan_percent_income`) are standardized using z-score normalization.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- `person_emp_length`: Number of years the borrower has been employed.
- `loan_int_rate`: The interest rate of the loan.
- `person_age`: Age of the borrower.
- `person_income`: The income of the borrower.
- `person_home_ownership`: Home ownership status (categorical).
- `loan_intent`: Purpose of the loan (categorical).
- `loan_grade`: Loan grade (categorical).
- `cb_person_default_on_file`: Indicates if the person has a default record on file (categorical).
- `loan_amnt`: Amount of the loan.
- `loan_percent_income`: Percentage of income taken by the loan.

## Model Hyperparameters

  - Random state (`random_state=42`)

- **Random Forest**
  - Iterations (`n_iter=100`)
  - RandomizedSearch (`random_state=37`)

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Maximum iterations (`max_iter=1000`)
